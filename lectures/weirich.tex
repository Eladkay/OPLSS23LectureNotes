\section{Implementing Dependent Types in pi-forall}
\subauthor{Stephanie Weirich}{University of Pennsylvania}

Sometimes it takes a little coding to really understand what is going on. This course will help students approach type systems through a demo implementation of a simple dependently-typed programming language, called pi-forall, using Haskell. The focus of the lectures will be on the pi-forall type checker and how we can take mathematical descriptions of typing rules and turn them into programming systems.
Lectures and homework will be based on the tutorial implementation available at https://github.com/sweirich/pi-forall
