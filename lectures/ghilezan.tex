\begin{abstract}
	The Lambda Cube is a framework introduced by Henk Barendregt to systematically investigate eight different systems of lambda calculi with types. The basic system is the lambda calculus with simple types and all other systems are obtained as its three-dimensional extensions with: polymorphic types, type operators and dependent types.
