\section{Introduction to Coq}
\subauthor{Jennifer Paykin}{Intel}
\begin{abstract}
	Coq is an interactive theorem prover that can be used to develop mechanized proofs of correctness for software systems. It uses dependent types and proof tactics to state and prove theorems about functional programs. This course will introduce Coq and the basics of interactive theorem provers through hands-on exercises and labs based on the Software Foundations curriculum.
